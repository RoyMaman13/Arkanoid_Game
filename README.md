# Arkanoid_Game

This is a personal project that I've been working on in OOP course in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan university. This is an Arkanoid game written in Java and was designed with multiple OOP principles and design patterns.

Mainly used design patterns in the project:

- Template Method
- Observable
- Facade

Note: Make sure that you download the attached jar file and that it's placed in the same directory as src file.
