# Arkanoid_Game

This is a personal project that I've been working on in OOP course in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan university. This is an Arkanoid game written in Java and was designed with multiple OOP principles and design patterns.

Mainly used design patterns in the project:

- Template Method
- Observable
- Facade

Note: Make sure that you download the attached jar file and that it's placed in the same directory as src file.
There are 4 levels, if no arguments are given the game will start from level 1 and by winning continue to level 2 and so on.
another option is to give the program arguments that will represent the game levels so the levels will appear in that order (for example - "4 2 1 1 3 2").

Here are some photos for the game demonstration
